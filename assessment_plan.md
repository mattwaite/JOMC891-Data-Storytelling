# Assessment Plan

Students in JOMC 891 Data Storytelling will be assessed primarily through twice weekly data challenges. Each week of the condensed course, students will be required to complete two data challenges implementing a specific concept into the R statistical programming language. Each challenge builds on the last, so students will have to complete the previous challenge in order to take on the next one.

Students will also be evaluated through a subjective assessment of the growth of their data storytelling skills by comparing a written assignment involving data analysis in the first week of the class to a final storytelling project that will be completed at the end of the course as a final project. Students will be evaluated, in both assignments, for how well they implement the steps of analysis and communicate the results.
