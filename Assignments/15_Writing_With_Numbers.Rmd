### The first thing you have to acknowledge is that numbers are hard to read. All else flows from that. 

They are complex words that take time for the mind to chew over. And if they are quite complex, or very large, our minds don't even grasp them firmly. 

What can you do? 

**Using ratios instead of percents** 

Ex. 6 out of 10, or 4 out of 10.

Why is that wrong and right?

**Unless the exact number IS the story, donâ€™t use exact numbers.**

What sounds better? Lincoln, Neb. has 258,379 people. Lincoln, Neb. has about 250,000 people.
Do you lose anything estimating?

**Use numbers to illustrate instead of just state facts.**

A compared to B.
12,000 approvals, 1 denial. 
X is 3 times the average. 

**Use radical tranparency and have a conversation with readers**
