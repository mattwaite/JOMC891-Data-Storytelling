R is a programming language, one specifically geared toward statistical analysis. Like all programming languages, it has certain built in functions and you can interact with it in multiple ways. The first, and most basic, is the console.

Think of the console like talking directly to R. It's direct, but it has some drawbacks and some quirks we'll get into later. For now, try typing this into the console 
```{r}
2+2
```
Congrats, you've run some code. It's not very complex, and you knew the answer before hand, but you get the idea. We can compute things. We can also store things. In programming languages, these are called variables or objects. We can assign things to variables using `<-`. And then we can do things with them. Try this in your console. 

```{r}
number <- 2

number * number
```
We can have as many variables as we can name. We can even reuse them (but be careful you know you're doing that or you'll introduce errors). Try this in your console.
```{r}
firstnumber <- 1
secondnumber <-2 

(firstnumber + secondnumber) * secondnumber

```
We can store anything in a variable. A whole table. An array of numbers. A single word. A whole book. All the books of the 18th century. They're really powerful. We'll exlore them all semester long. 

### Adding libraries

The real strength of any given programming language is the external libraries that power it. The base language can do a lot, but it's the external libraries that solve many specific problems -- even making the base language easier to use. 

For this class, we're going to need several external libraries. We'll mostly use two libraries for analysis -- dplyr and ggplot2. To get them, and several other useful libraries, we can install a single collection of libraries called the tinyverse. Type this into your console: `install.packages('tidyverse')`

Then, to help us with learning and replication, we're going to use R Notebooks. So we need to install that library. Type this into your console: `install.packages('rmarkdown')`

You may have to quit and restart R Studio. I honestly can't remember.
